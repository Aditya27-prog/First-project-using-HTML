    <p>The boilerplate code is activated by including the necessary HTML structure and elements in your document. This typically involves:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First of All press  Shift + !</li>
        <li>Defining the document type with < !DOCTYPE html ></li >
        <li>Creating the < html > element with the appropriate language attribute</li >
        <li>Including the < head > section with meta tags and the document title</li>
        <li>Adding a < body > section where the main content will reside</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How Fill path works</h2>
    <p>The fill path in HTML is used to define the color and pattern that fills a shape or area within an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) element. It is specified using the "fill" attribute within SVG elements such as < rect >, < circle >, < ellipse >, < polygon >, and < path >. The fill attribute can take various values, including color names (e.g., "red", "blue"), hexadecimal color codes (e.g., "#FF0000"), RGB values (e.g., "rgb(255, 0, 0)"), or even gradients and patterns defined within the SVG.</p>
    <h2>How div tag worked</h2>
    <p>The < div > tag in HTML is a block-level element that is used to group other HTML elements together. It is often used for layout purposes and can be styled using CSS. The < div > tag does not have any semantic meaning on its own, but it can be given a class or id attribute to apply specific styles or scripts to the grouped elements.</p>
<h2>how Class tag worked</h2>
<p>The class attribute in HTML is used to specify a class for an HTML element. It can be used to apply CSS styles to multiple elements at once or to target specific elements with JavaScript. The class attribute can take multiple class names, separated by spaces, allowing for greater flexibility in styling and scripting.</p>
<h2>How ID tag worked</h2>
<p>The id attribute in HTML is used to assign a unique identifier to an HTML element. This identifier can be used to target the element with CSS for styling or with JavaScript for manipulation. Unlike class names, which can be shared among multiple elements, an id must be unique within a page.</p>
