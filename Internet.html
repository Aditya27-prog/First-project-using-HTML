        <h4>What is Internet:</h4>
           <p> The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols. It enables the sharing of information and resources across vast distances, facilitating communication, collaboration, and access to a wealth of knowledge.</p>

           <h4>
            What is dat transfer:
           </h4>
              <p>Data transfer refers to the movement of data from one location to another, typically over a network or between devices. It involves the transmission of digital information, such as files, documents, images, or any other type of data, from a source to a destination.</p>
         <h4>What is Ip Address:</h4>
              <p>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the device in the network.</p>
              <h4>How to access the website:</h4>
                <p>To access a website, you typically use a web browser and enter the website's URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address bar. The browser then sends a request to the web server hosting the website, which responds by delivering the requested web pages and resources to your browser for display.</p>
    <h4>
        Who assigned the Ip Address:
    </h4>
        <p>IP addresses are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and distributed by regional Internet registries (RIRs) to Internet service providers (ISPs) and organizations. ISPs then allocate IP addresses to their customers, such as individuals and businesses, for use on the internet.</p>
        <h4>Concept of DNS:</h4>
        <p>DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses like 192.0.2.1. This process allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names instead of having to remember numerical IP addresses.</p>
        <h4>Indepth Working of DNS:</h4>
        <p>The DNS works by using a distributed database of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses. When a user enters a domain name into their web browser, the browser sends a DNS query to a DNS resolver, which is typically provided by the user's ISP. The resolver then queries a series of DNS servers to find the authoritative DNS server for the domain. Once it obtains the IP address, it returns it to the user's browser, allowing the browser to connect to the web server hosting the website.</p>
        <h4>problems in Data Transfer and MAC Address</h4>
        <p>Problems in data transfer can include issues such as data corruption, packet loss, latency, and bandwidth limitations. These problems can affect the speed and reliability of data transmission over a network. A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on the physical network segment. Problems with MAC addresses can include address conflicts, spoofing, and unauthorized access to a network.</p>
        <h4>What is Port number:</h4>
        <p>A port number is a numerical identifier in networking used to distinguish between different services or applications running on a device. It allows multiple services to run on a single IP address by using different port numbers. For example, web traffic typically uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS.</p>
<h4>IPV4 & IPV6:</h4>
        <p>IPV4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing for over 4 billion unique addresses. IPV6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the successor to IPV4 and uses a 128-bit address scheme, allowing for a vastly larger number of unique IP addresses. The transition from IPV4 to IPV6 is necessary to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet.</p>
        <h4>MAC address format</h4>
        <p>A MAC address is typically represented as a string of six pairs of hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (:) or hyphens (-). For example, a MAC address may be displayed as 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E or 00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E. This format helps to uniquely identify network interfaces at the data link layer of the OSI model.</p>
        <h4>Port number Format:</h4>
        <p>A port number is usually represented as a 16-bit unsigned integer, allowing for a range of values from 0 to 65535. Port numbers are often categorized into three ranges: well-known ports (0-1023), registered ports (1024-49151), and dynamic or private ports (49152-65535). Well-known ports are assigned by the IANA for specific services, while registered and dynamic ports can be used by applications as needed.</p>
        <h4>Local area Network,Switch,& Router:</h4>
        <p>A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or campus. A switch is a networking device that connects devices within a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination. A router is a device that connects multiple networks, such as a LAN to the internet, and uses IP addresses to route data between them.</p>
        <h4>Public and private Addresses</h4>
        <p>Public IP addresses are unique addresses assigned to devices that are directly accessible over the internet. They are used for communication between devices on different networks. Private IP addresses, on the other hand, are used within private networks and are not routable on the internet. They allow devices within a local network to communicate with each other without using public IP addresses.</p>
    <h4>Modern Router</h4>
    <p>A modern router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It connects multiple networks, such as a home network to the internet, and uses IP addresses to route data between them. Modern routers often include features such as firewall protection, Wi-Fi connectivity, and support for IPv6.</p>
    <h4>What is A vpn</h4>
    <p>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. VPNs are used to protect private web traffic from snooping, interference, and censorship. By using a VPN, users can access region-restricted websites and maintain their privacy online.</p>
    <h4>What is Web Development</h4>
    <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites. It involves a combination of programming, design, and content creation to build functional and visually appealing web pages. Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development, which focuses on the user interface and user experience, and back-end development, which deals with the server-side logic and database management.</p>
<h4>What is MERN Stack:
</h4>
    <p>MERN Stack is a popular web development stack that consists of four main technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. MongoDB is a NoSQL database used for storing data, Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, React.js is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. Together, these technologies provide a full-stack solution for building modern web applications.</p>
<h4>Who is A full-stack Developer?</h4>
    <p>A full-stack developer is a software developer who is proficient in working on both the front-end and back-end of web applications. They have a diverse skill set that includes knowledge of various programming languages, frameworks, and tools used in web development. Full-stack developers are capable of handling all aspects of a web application, from designing the user interface to managing the server-side logic and database interactions.</p>
